PgBouncer 1.19.0 has been released.  This release contains several
small new features and some important bug fixes.  A new option
`auth_dbname` and a new command `SHOW STATE` have been added, as well
as additional facilities to manage cancel requests.  A bug introduced
in version 1.18.0 that affected a number of users has been fixed, so
users of that version are especially encouraged to upgrade.

See the full details in the [changelog](/changelog.html#pgbouncer-119x).
