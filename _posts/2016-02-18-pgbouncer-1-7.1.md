# WARNING: 1.7.x behaviour change

Since version 1.7, `server_reset_query` is not executed when
database is in transaction-pooling mode.  Seems this was not highlighted
enough in 1.7 announcement.  If your apps depend on that happening, use
`server_reset_query_always` to restore previous behaviour.
