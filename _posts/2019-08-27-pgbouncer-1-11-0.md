PgBouncer 1.11.0 is out.  The major new feature is support for SCRAM
authentication.

This release also adds support for a new startup packet type
introduced in PostgreSQL 12 (GSSENCRequest), so this release is
recommended for a better experience with PostgreSQL 12 and beyond.

See the full details in the [changelog](/changelog.html#pgbouncer-111x).
