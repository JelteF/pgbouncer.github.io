# Security fix

New `auth_user` functionality introduced in 1.6 allows
login as `auth_user` when client presents unknown
username.  It's quite likely `auth_user` is superuser.
Affects only setups that have enabled `auth_user` in
their config.


# Per-pool pooling mode vs. reset query.

PgBouncer 1.6 introduced per-pool pooling mode, but session-pooled connections
should not use same reset query as transaction-pooled connections.  In fact,
transaction-pooled conections should not use any reset query.

To fix this, there is new setting: `server_reset_query_always`.  When set, it
disables `server_reset_query` use on non-session pools.

It is set in 1.6.x for compatibility reasons, but will be unset in 1.7.
