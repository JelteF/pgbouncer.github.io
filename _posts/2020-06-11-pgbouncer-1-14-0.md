PgBouncer 1.14.0 is out.  This release contains several significant
enhancements.

Encrypted SCRAM secrets in PgBouncer can now be used for server-side
login, so storing plain-text passwords in PgBouncer is no longer
necessary to be able to use SCRAM.  The systemd integration has been
enhanced to support socket activation.  Also, PgBouncer now supports
Unix-domain sockets on Windows, matching the new capabilities of
PostgreSQL 13.

See the full details in the [changelog](/changelog.html#pgbouncer-114x).
